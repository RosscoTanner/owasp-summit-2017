I currently run the Information Security & Risk practice at La Fosse Associate (the IT, Digital & Business Change recruitment firm), specialising in senior appointments within the sector. I see first-hand on a daily basis the growing need for technically skilled InfoSec professionals, from the C level through to hands on, sleeves rolled up specialists. Having successfully placed members of the OWASP community in the past, I'm fully aware of the value that the people within this community can bring to organisations out there and am hoping to provide some insights around what those organisations look for and how to go about securing them.
